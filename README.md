# ProcedualCaveGeneration
Procedurally generated 3D- mesh for terrain.

In this repo, I'm creating a terrain generator using cellular automata based on the Youtube tutoral series by Sebastian Lague.

My intention is to understand and recreate the source code and hopefully learn something from it.

The code is implemented in Unity version 2020.1.8f1.
